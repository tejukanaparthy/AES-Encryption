# AES-Encryption

## Description
This tool provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption via the Fernet symmetric encryption system, part of the Python `cryptography` library. It also includes key generation and file integrity checks.

## Features
- **Key Generation**: Generates a new cryptographic key and saves it to a file.
- **File Encryption**: Encrypts a given file using the generated key.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted file using the correct key.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `cryptography` library

## Installation
